## Catnip Suggestions

We suggest replanting your catnip into a larger pot (studies show that pot size has a  direct impact on plant size).  Once you have done that water daily so soil is slightly damp. (Not wet to the touch but damp if you rub your fingers after touching the soil). In Singapore we find that the plant likes diffuse sunlight but direct sunlight burns the leaves (especially at mid day). 

We recommend as much light as possible but avoiding direct mid day sun.  The catnip plant in the photo is about three months old.  In addition, biweekly spraying with a slightly soapy solution will reduce white bug formation and daily spraying with water to hydrate the leaves.

Please talk to your plants in a kindly voice.  :)

#### Benefits

Catnip provides a range of benefits to your pet like releasing endorphins and other natural 'high' benefits.  In addition, catnip can be mosquito control for your house or apartment as catnip has a natural mosquito repellant scent.  Cats sometimes roll in catnip for this reason.
