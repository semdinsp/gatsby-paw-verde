## Catnip Suggestions

We suggest replanting your catnip into a larger pot (studies show that pot size has a  direct impact on plant size).  Once you have done that water daily so soil is slightly damp.  In Singapore we find that the plant likes diffuse sunlight but direct sunlight burns the leaves (especially at mid day).

We recommend as much light as possible but avoiding direct mid day sun.  The catnip plant in the photo is about three months old.  In addition, biweekly spraying with a slightly soapy solution will reduce white bug formation and daily spraying with water to hydrate the leaves.

Please talk to your plants in a kindly voice.  :)

## Wheatgrass Suggestions

Our experience shows that the wheat grass grows super easily.  The only challenge is to cut the grass back to encourage more growing.  In addition replanting in a larger pot is recommended.  Water for dampish soil is recommended.  Indirect sunlight is also recommended for Singapore.

Our technique for wheat grass growing is as followings.  Grow the seeds (soaked overnight) in a smaller container in a round shape (generally on paper towel to retain moisture).  Replant this into the soil after the seeds are growing well.  This is primarily to make the plant attractive.

Wheat grass generally dies after a month unless you aggressively manage the height.
