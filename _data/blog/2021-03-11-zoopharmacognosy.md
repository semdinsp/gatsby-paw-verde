## Your feline self medicates

Did you know that your cat is smart enough to self medicate with catnip for mosquitos and grass for stomach issues.  For mosquitos they roll in the catnip.  They eat the grass to settle their stomaches.  We provide organic locally grown plants to help your pets meet their needs

### Canines also!

Canines will also self medicate with grass but generally to induce vomiting if their stomaches are upset.
