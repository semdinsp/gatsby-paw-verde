## Wheatgrass Suggestions

Our experience shows that the wheat grass grows super easily.  The only challenge is to cut the grass back to encourage more growing. If you don't cut it back after about three days it will go brown. In addition replanting in a larger pot is recommended.  Water for dampish soil is recommended (very little water).  Indirect sunlight is also recommended for Singapore.

Our technique for wheat grass growing is as followings.  Grow the seeds (soaked overnight) in a smaller container in a round shape (generally on paper towel to retain moisture).  Replant this into the soil after the seeds are growing well.  This is primarily to make the plant attractive.

Wheat grass plants generally dies after a month unless you aggressively manage the height.  If you don't trim  back the plant aggressively it will grow brown after a week and then likely die after another week.

#### Benefits

Wheatgrass generally aids in digestion for cats.  They eat it and sometime regurgitate it to get rid of hairballs.  Cats are normally smart enough to do the correct dosage but if your cat is eating too much just move the plant.
