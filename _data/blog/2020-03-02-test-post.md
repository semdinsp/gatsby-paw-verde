We sell catnip, catgrass and other plants for pets directly to consumers and to pet stores.  We plan to provide attractive payment plans for pets stores to increase their revenues and ensuring that costs are linked to incoming revenues.

We are working to optimize our packaging and displays cases so that it is consumer friendly and retail friendly (and our plants are sprouting :).  We started shipping plants to stores in mid April.

At an average store we sell 5-10 catnip plants per week and similar amount of wheatgrass.
