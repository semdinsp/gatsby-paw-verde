We plan to sell catnip, catgrass and other plants for pets directly to consumers and to pet stores.  We plan to provide attractive payment plans for pets stores to increase their revenues and ensuring that costs are linked to incoming revenues.

We are working to opitimize our packaging so that it is consumer friendly and retail friendly (and our plants are sprouting :).  We expect to start shipping plants to stores in mid April.
